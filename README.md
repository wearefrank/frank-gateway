# frank-api-gateway

The Frank API Gateway is based on Apache APISIX, see https://apisix.apache.org/ for an introduction to Apache APISIX.

The main characteristics of Apache APISIX are:
- Fully Open Source â€“ part of the Apache foundation as a top level project with large contributor base
- Run everywhere (including ARM64)
    - Bare metal
    - Kubernetes
    - Cloud
    - VM
- Pluggable configuration based on a rich plugin ecosystem
- Top ranked for performance

The Frank API Gateway is a superset of Apache APISIX.
- Improved functionality for SOAP services
    - Routing based on SOAP action
    - Analytics based on SOAP action
- FSC NLX Inway
    - Can act as a Inway in a FSC NLX group
    - Can combine the FSC NLX Inway with different APISIX plugins 

## Layout & Structure

This repository contains two components:
1) deployment configurations & examples which can be found on the directory `deployment-examples`
2) source code for FSC plugin

### Deployment configurations & examples
The directory `deployment-examples` contains four deployment scenarios for deploying APISIX. Note, this deploys vanilla APISIX without the FSC plugin.
The goal of these deployment examples is for experimenting with Apache APISIX in different deployment approaches.

Without any prior Apache APISIX experience it is recommended to start with the `docker-compose` deployment-example since this is the easiest one to get started.

The `docker-compose deployment` does contain the `improved SOAP functionality` mentioned above. 

- docker-compose -> deploys APISIX via Docker compose [instructions](deployment-examples/docker-compose/README.md)
- kind -> deploys APISIX in normal mode on a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind [instructions](deployment-examples/kind/README.md)
- kind-ingress -> deploys APISIX as a Kubernetes ingress on a local cluster using Kind [instructions](deployment-examples/kind-ingress/README.md)
- rancher -> deploys APISIX as a Kubernetes ingress on the WAF rancher cluster [instructions](deployment-examples/rancher/README.md)

### FSC plugin
All other directories and files are part of the `fsc plugin` created for the Frank API Gateway.

The FSC plugin:
- Can act as a Inway in a FSC NLX group
- Can combine the FSC NLX Inway with different APISIX plugins 

Detailed documentation on the FSC plugin and how to run and test the FSC plugin locally can be found [here](FSC-NLX.md)
